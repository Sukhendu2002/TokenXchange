# TokenXchange
TokenXchange is a decentralized platform that enables users to swap and send tokens across different blockchain networks. The platform supports cross-chain transactions, allowing users to exchange tokens from one blockchain network to another seamlessly. This provides users with greater flexibility and accessibility to a wider range of digital assets.

TokenXchange operates on a peer-to-peer network, eliminating the need for intermediaries, such as banks or other financial institutions. This ensures faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to traditional financial systems. Additionally, TokenXchange offers users increased security and privacy as it is built on a decentralized blockchain network.

# Challenges I ran into
During the development of TokenXchange, several challenges were encountered, including technical and deplyment challenges.

Technical challenges included encountering technical issues like deprecated internal packages while using the Router-Protocol JavaScript SDK, which caused delays in the project. The workaround was to use the API, which required additional development efforts. Additionally, challenges arose when deploying smart contracts due to issues like incorrect configurations, incompatible protocols, or inadequate testing.

Financial challenges also arose during the testing of TokenXchange. Insufficient funds were a significant challenge when testing a project like TokenXchange. Without enough funds, it was challenging to test the project's scalability, transaction speeds, and other essential metrics.

Overall, the development of TokenXchange involved overcoming various technical and financial hurdles. However, with careful planning, rigorous testing, and ongoing maintenance, these challenges were mitigated to ensure the project's success.
